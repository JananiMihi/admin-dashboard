# Fixed: Duplicate Headers and Sidebars

## Problem
The dashboard was showing duplicate headers and sidebars because:
1. `app/dashboard/layout.tsx` wraps ALL dashboard pages with `DashboardLayout`
2. Individual pages were also importing and using `DashboardLayout` again

## Solution
- Removed `DashboardLayout` wrapper from all individual pages
- Kept the wrapper only in `app/dashboard/layout.tsx`
- Now there's only ONE header and sidebar, controlled by the layout

## Files Changed
All dashboard pages have been updated:
- Removed `import DashboardLayout` from imports
- Removed `<DashboardLayout>` wrapper tags
- Pages now return content directly (wrapped by the layout.tsx)

## How It Works Now
```
app/dashboard/layout.tsx
└── Wraps everything with DashboardLayout
    ├── app/dashboard/overview/page.tsx (just returns content)
    ├── app/dashboard/users/page.tsx (just returns content)
    ├── app/dashboard/missions/page.tsx (just returns content)
    └── ... all other pages
```

## Result
✅ Single header at the top
✅ Single sidebar on the left
✅ Clean, proper Next.js layout structure
